","Based on the job description provided, none of the applicants seem to be a perfect fit as the role is for a Java Developer with a focus on data analytics and requires an active TS/SCI security clearance. However, if we focus on the data analytics aspect of the job description, Applicant ID 207 seems to be the most suitable candidate.

Applicant ID 207 has a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi. He has extensive experience in data mining/data analysis methods, building and implementing models, using/creating algorithms, and creating/running simulations. He is proficient in statistical computer languages (R, Python, etc.) to manipulate data and draw insights from large data sets. He also has experience in creating data architectures and using Cloud Architecture like AWS, Azure, etc. He has worked as a Data Scientist at XYZ Company, Bangalore from 2018-2021 where he developed and evolved core commercial models used across all analytics packages, designed data test and learn experiments to drive personalized solutions across the customer journeys, and led the development and implementation measurement planning aligning to strategy among other responsibilities. He has also increased revenue by 20% by developing personalized solutions across the customer journeys and improved customer satisfaction by 15% by implementing predictive modeling to optimize business outcomes. He holds certifications like Certified Machine Learning Engineer (CME), Certified Data Scientist (CDS), and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.

However, it's important to note that this candidate may not be eligible for the role as he is located in Bangalore and the job description requires the candidate to be a U.S. citizen with an active TS/SCI security clearance. Also, the job requires proficiency in Java, which is not explicitly mentioned in his resume. Therefore, while he seems to be the most suitable candidate based on his data analytics skills and experience, he may not meet all the requirements for the role.","['Applicant ID 58\n - \n\nName: John Doe\n\nContact Information: \nEmail: johndoe@email.com\nPhone: 555-555-5555\n\nSummary:\nA highly motivated and detail-oriented Data Analyst with 3 years of experience in the Machine Learning industry.
